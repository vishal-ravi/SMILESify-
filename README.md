# SMILESify-
SMILESify is a user-friendly Python-based GUI tool for extracting SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) notations from SDF (Structure-Data File) format. Built with Tkinter and RDKit, it allows users to process multiple SDF files, visualize extracted SMILES, and save them as CSV files for further analysis.
