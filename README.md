## 📌 **Overview**  
**SMILESify** is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) tool that allows users to extract **SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) notations** from **SDF (Structure-Data File) format**. It is designed for **chemists, bioinformaticians, and structural biologists** who need a simple, fast, and efficient way to convert molecular structures into SMILES representations.  

---

## 🎯 **Features**  
✅ **Batch Processing** – Extracts SMILES from multiple SDF files in a selected folder.  
✅ **Modern GUI** – Built with **Tkinter** and **ttkbootstrap** for an intuitive user experience.  
✅ **Data Preview** – Displays extracted SMILES in a sortable table.  
✅ **CSV Export** – Save extracted SMILES for easy data handling and further analysis.  
✅ **Progress Indicator** – Real-time progress bar for smooth user interaction.  
✅ **Lightweight & Fast** – Does not require heavy installations, making it efficient for quick extractions.
